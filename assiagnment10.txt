1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
ans:
 shutil.copy():
     The shutil.copy() is a function which is used to copy the file from source to the destination.
     It takes two arguments, one is source path and the another one is destination path.
 shutil.copytree():
     The shutil.copytree() is a function which can be used to copy all the files form source directory to
     the destination directory. It takes two arguments, one is source directory path and the another one is 
     destination directory path.

2. What function is used to rename files?
ans:
   To rename the file we use os.rename() function which takes two arguments where one is old file name 
   and another one is new file name.

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
ans:
  "send2trash" sends the files or directories to the operating system's trash or recycle bin instead of permanently
  deleting them. This means that if you delete something by mistake, you can usually still recover it from the trash.
  But in case of, shutil deletes files and directories permanently.

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
ans:
 The ZipFile method that is equivalent to File objects open() method is ZipFile() itself.

5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
ans:
The below code will demonstrates the above function:

#importing the libraries

import os
import shutil

# specify the source directory to search for files
source_directory = 'path/to/source/folder'

# specify the destination directory to copy the files to
destination_directory = 'path/to/destination/folder'

# specify the file extension to search for
file_extension = '.pdf'

# iterate over all files in the source directory tree
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_directory):
    for file in files:
        # check if the file has the desired file extension
        if file.endswith(file_extension):
            # construct the full path to the source file
            source_file = os.path.join(root, file)
            # construct the full path to the destination file
            destination_file = os.path.join(destination_directory, file)
            # copy the file to the destination directory
            shutil.copy2(source_file, destination_file)
