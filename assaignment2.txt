  They are True and False.
  a=True
  b=False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
 They are AND , OR and  NOT are the three different types of boolean operators.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

answer:
 AND operation:
   lst1=[0,0,1,1]
   lst2=[0,1,0,1]
   lst1 and lst2=[0,0,0,1]
 OR operation:
   lst1=[0,0,1,1]
   lst2=[0,1,0,1]
   lst1 or lst2=[0,1,1,1]
 NOT operation:
   lst=[0,1]
   not lst=[1,0]

 
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 >4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

answer:
 (5 > 4) and (3 == 5): False
 not (5 >4): False
 not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)): False
 (True and True) and (True == False): False
 (not False) or (not True): True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
answer:
 1.greater: >
 2.lesser: <
 3.greater than or equal: >=
 4.lesser than or equal: <=
 5.not equal: !=
 6.equal operator : == 

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
answer:
  equal operator is used to  check whether the conditions are matched or not means whether two values are equal or not.
  like (3==3), used with "==".
  where as assignment operator is used to assign the value for the variable. It is used with "=".

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam &gt; 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')

print('spam')

answer:
 There are three blocks and the output willbe 
  ham
  spam
  spam

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

answer:
  spam=int(input("enter a value"))
  if(spam==1):
      print("hello")
  elif(spam==2):
      print("howdy")
  else:
      print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
  answer:

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
 answer:
  Break: This statement will be used to get out from the loop when it is encountered.
  Continue: This statement will be used to skip that condition only when it is encountered.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

answer:
  Above All are same.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
answer:
   #for loop
   for i in range(1,11):
         print(i)
   #while loop
   i=1
   while(i<=10):
       print(i)
       i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
