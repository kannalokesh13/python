2.In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value "hello" as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
answer:
 spam[2]="hello"

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a','b','c','d'] for  the next three queries.

3.What is the value of spam[int(int('3'* 2) / 11)]?
answer:
 'd'.

4.What is the value of spam[-1]?
answer:
 'd'.

5.What is the value of spam[:2]?
answer:
 ['a','b']

Let's pretend bacon has the list[3.14,'cat',11,'cat',True] for the next three questions.

6.What is the value of bacon.index['cat']?
answer:
 1.

7.How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
answer:
 [3.14,'cat',11,'cat',True,99]

8.How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
answer:
 [3.14,11,'cat',True,99]

9.What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
answer:
 '+' is the concatenation operator.
 '*' is the replication operator.

10.What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
answer:
 The append() method will be used to add the element at the end of the list and
 the insert() method will be used to add the element at the desired position in a list.

11.What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
answer:
 If "lst" is the list ,then lst.remove() and lst.pop().

12.Describe how list values and string values are identical.

13.What's the difference between tuples and lists?

 The tuples are immutable and the lists are mutable.

14.How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
answer:
 tuple=(42,)

15.How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
answer:
 To get the list value's in tuple form use this statement "list(tuple)".
 To get the tuple value's in list form use this statement "tuple(list)".

16.Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
answer:
 Variables containing the reference of the list of values.

17.How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
answer:
 copy.copy() does not generates new duplicate of a original one, if the data in duplicate changes, then the data in 
 original copy also changes.
 But, copy.deepcopy() generates new duplicate of a original one, if the data in duplicate changes, then the data in 
 original copy does not changes.
