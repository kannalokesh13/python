Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.
ans:
  1. Error Handling
  2. Custom Exception Exception Handling.

Q2. What happens if you don&#39;t do something extra to treat an exception?
ans:
  If an exception is not handled or caught by the program, it will result in an unhandled exception, 
  which can cause the program to terminate abruptly. When an unhandled exception occurs, the default behavior 
  is for the Python interpreter to print a traceback message that includes information about the exception type, 
  the line of code where the exception occurred, and the call stack.
  EX:
  Like Zero division Error.

Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?
ans:
  1. Catching and Handling the Exception
  2. Logging the Exception.
Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.
ans:
  1. Raising an exception.
  2. By default getting an exception when error encounters.

Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of
whether or not an exception exists.
ans:
 By using the Finally block we can execute what ever we want.
