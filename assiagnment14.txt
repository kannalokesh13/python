1. What does RGBA stand for?
ans:
 The RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha,

2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?
ans:
  By using the getpixel() method, we can get the RGBA value of any images.

3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?
ans:
  In Pillow, a box tuple is a tuple of four integer values that represent the left, upper, right, and 
  lower pixel coordinates of a rectangular box. The syntax is (left, upper, right, lower). 
  For example, (0, 0, 100, 100) would represent a box that starts at pixel (0, 0) in the upper left 
  corner of an image and ends at pixel (100, 100) in the lower right corner.
  The box tuple is mainly used to crop the image.

4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an
Image object?
ans:
 from PIL import Image

 img = Image.open('example.jpg')

 width, height = img.size

 print(width)
 print(height)

5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left
quarter of it?
ans:
  To get an Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can use 
  the crop() method of the Image object.

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?
ans:
 By using the save() method we can save an image.
 For example, if i have the image object as im, then

 im.save('image/path')

7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
ans:
  The ImageDraw module contains Pillow's shape-drawing code.
