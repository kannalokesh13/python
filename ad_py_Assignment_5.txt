Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?
ans:
  A class which inherits two parent classes at the same time.
  example:
   class A:
     def __init__(self):
      
  class B:
     def __init__(self):
  
  class C(A,B):
     def __init__(self_:

Q2. What is the concept of delegation?
ans:
   Delegation allows for composition and modular design, where objects can collaborate by relying on 
   the specialized behavior of other objects. It promotes code reuse and flexibility by separating responsibilities 
   and enabling objects to work together without tight coupling.

Q3. What is the concept of composition?
ans:
  Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves constructing complex objects by 
  combining simpler objects. It allows objects to be composed of other objects, forming a hierarchical relationship where 
  the composed objects are responsible for different aspects of the functionality.

Q4. What are bound methodsÂ and how do we use them?
ans:
  In Python, a bound method is a method that is associated with an instance of a class. It is a callable object that is bound 
  to a specific instance, allowing it to access and operate on the instance's data.

Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?
ans:
  Pseudoprivate attributes, also known as name mangling, are a convention in Python to indicate that an attribute should be 
  treated as private, even though Python does not have true private members like some other programming languages.
